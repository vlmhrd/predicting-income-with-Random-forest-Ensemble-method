# predicting-income-with-Random-forest-Ensemble-method

# Goal
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model to predict individual income levels using the Random Forest ensemble technique. The aim is to explore how ensemble methods can improve predictive performance on income-related data. Data taken from [UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/20/census+income)

# Description
This project utilizes a dataset containing various demographic and socioeconomic features to predict whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and preprocessing, the data is prepared for modeling. The Random Forest algorithm is employed due to its effectiveness in handling classification problems and its ability to manage feature interactions and non-linear relationships.

The workflow includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights and feature selection
- Implementation of the Random Forest ensemble model for income prediction
- Model evaluation using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
- Visualization of results and feature importances
- This project demonstrates how ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest can be leveraged to address real-world classification tasks.
